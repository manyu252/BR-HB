Work for calculation the breathing rate in html and js

**Objective:** 
1. To show webcam video in the browser at fullscreen.
2. Wherever the mouse hovers, a 40x40 pixel block from the video is cropped and is shown on a 100x100 canvas element.

**Work done until now:**
1. Displayed video.
2. Made the canvas element and displayed the specified cropped part of the video on it.

**Problems:**
1. I have displayed the video but its not fullscreen.
2. I'm not able to get the canvas element on top of the video element.
Those are the first issues I want to overcome.

**Pending work:**
1. Make the cropped image hover over the video wherever the mouse goes.
2. Further steps also include making the canvas element into monochrome and take only 5 frames per second, but those are easy tasks if the remaining is achieved.

That is the whole plan. It is not the penultimate objective but this will give a good grasp on the project.
There is no real time limit but the sooner the better.
